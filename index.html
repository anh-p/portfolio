      <div class="about-text">
      <p>I started my career in tech as a software tester about three years ago, and currently work as a QA Analyst at a media company. During my prior life in the finance industry, I developed critical analytical skills and attention to detail, and wanted to find ways to leverage those skills in an industry that I was more passionate about.</p>
      <p>I discovered that I love building things and seeing the direct output of my efforts, which lead me to discover an interest in software development. I am currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javscript, and am keen to learn more so that I can better support the teams I work with</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I love making nutrtionally sound meals, traveling and pet sitting.</p>
      <p>I look forward to learning how to make apps that are useful and enhance people's lives in one way or another.</p>
